the main motive of video is that how we build a super attractive and a responsive template
with the help of only HTML and CSS.CSS has always been one of the most important parts of the
web development, weâ€™ve been building and improving new ways to work with it since the beginning
of browsers. A few years ago, creating web page layouts was a very hard job. We were using some
CSS properties such as float, positioning a lot of elements with position, and inline-block
styling. previously we use some frameworks and bootstrap to make the template responsive and
attractive but now with the help of Media Queries and flex and grid we can do all the stuff
that we previously do with the help of frameworks and bootstrap there are some CSS properties
like Media Queries where we put some max-min size for screen  to make our template responsive
and also we have flex properties in flex we have position-relative and position-absolute and 
some more properties that we can use to make the template responsive and look attractive.basically
we divide our template in box pattern to simplyfied our task.

when we have to use flex like if we build a navbar and some content that we want to float over the
page so we have to use css-flex and for the box pattern like template we have to go for the CSS-grid.
